# Molecule Testing

This role supports [Molecule](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/molecule/), an Ansible testing framework designed for developing and testing Ansible collections, playbooks, and roles.

## Prerequisites

To utilize Molecule you need to prepare several requirements:

- **x86** computer running one of these operating systems that make use of [systemd](https://systemd.io/):
  - **Archlinux**
  - **CentOS**, **Rocky Linux**, **AlmaLinux**, or possibly other RHEL alternatives (although your mileage may vary)
  - **Debian** (10/Buster or newer)
  - **Ubuntu** (18.04 or newer, although [20.04 may be problematic](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/ansible.md#supported-ansible-versions) if you run the Ansible playbook on it)
- `root` access on the computer which Molecule runs against
- [Ansible](http://ansible.com/) program
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - Most distributions install Python by default, but some don't (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04) and require manual installation (something like `apt-get install python3`)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
  - Access to Docker UNIX socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is required by default

## Installation

To set up the environment for using Molecule, run the command below on the terminal:

```bash
python3 -m venv ./molecule/venv
source ./molecule/venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r ./molecule/requirements.txt
```

## Scenarios

Currently there is one testing scenario available.

### `default`

Installs Lidarr the way the role does and then checks that the installation is
the role's doing rather than the image's.

The scenario configures the role with values Lidarr cannot arrive at on its
own (a port that is not Lidarr's built-in 8686, a timezone whose offset no
other timezone shares, a fixed API key, an instance name, an additional bind
mount) and asserts each of them on the running process. It then creates a tag over the
authenticated API, reads it back, and cross-checks the row in the SQLite
database under the role's data path, so the API cannot be answering out of
memory. The version the running container reports is compared, character for
character, against the `lidarr_version` leaf in `defaults/main.yml` that
Renovate edits.

Alongside it runs the same image with none of the role's configuration. That
one serves HTTP 200 on `/`, answers `/ping` and hands out its API key at
`/initialize.json` without being asked to, which is why none of those are used
as evidence: the scenario asserts that the stock image rejects the role's API
key and does not listen on the role's port.

## Running

By default it is configured to run the scenarios on Ubuntu 26.04.

```bash
molecule test --scenario-name default
```

You can utilize other distributions by setting one to the `MOLECULE_DISTRO` environment variable:

```bash
# Ubuntu 24.04
MOLECULE_DISTRO=ubuntu2404 molecule test --scenario-name default

# Debian 13
MOLECULE_DISTRO=debian13 molecule test --scenario-name default

# Debian 12
MOLECULE_DISTRO=debian12 molecule test --scenario-name default
```
